![REPL preview in C# and F#](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/547415/121978422-02497600-cd3d-11eb-96c6-9725bda6dcaa.png)

This project is an experiment using [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) and [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole) to create a polyglot .NET REPL for use on the command line. 

This is a personal project. Hopefully you enjoy it and find it useful. Contributions are welcome.

## Installation

To install `dotnet-repl`, run the following in your terminal:

```console
> dotnet tool install -g dotnet-repl
```

## Features

Here's what you can do with it:

### *Code in C#*

You can start `dotnet-repl` in one of a number of different language modes. The default is C#, so the following two commands are equivalent:

```console
> dotnet-repl --default-kernel csharp
> dotnet-repl
```

Once the REPL has started, you can type C# code at the prompt and run it by pressing `Enter`. (Note that this is the [C# scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2016/january/essential-net-csharp-scripting) dialect, which is also used in Visual Studio's C# Interactive Window and in .NET Interactive Notebooks.)

One notable feature of C# scripting is the ability to specify a return value for a code submission using a "trailing expression":

### *Code in F#*

You can also start up the REPL in F# mode:

```console
> dotnet-repl --default-kernel fsharp
```

### 📝 *Submit multi-line entries*

By pressing `Shift-Enter`, you can add multiple lines before running your code using `Enter`. This can be useful for creating multi-line code constructs, including declaring classes.

Another handy aspect of multi-line entries is that you no longer need to use the the F# Interactive convention of terminating a line with `;;` to indicate that the accumulated submission should be run. Pressing `Enter` will submit the code, and if you need more than one line of code at a time, you can use `Shift-Enter` to add lines before submitting.

### 🚥 *Switch languages within the same session*

### 🎁 *Add NuGet packages*

You can use `#r nuget` to install a package for the duration of the current session.

### *Initialize your REPL session using a notebook*

You can use a notebook file (either `.ipynb` or `.dib`) as an initialization script for the REPL.

```console
> dotnet-repl --notebook /path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

### *Run a notebook as a script*

You might also want to just use a notebook as a non-interactive script. You can do this by adding the `--exit-after-run` flag.


```console
> dotnet-repl --notebook /path/to/notebook.ipynb --exit-after-run
```


### 💁‍♀️ *Ask for help*

You can see help for the REPL by running the `#!help` magic command. I won't print it here because it's a work in progress. Just give it a try.

### ⌨ *Keyboard shortcuts*

`dotnet-repl` supports a number of keyboard shortcuts. These will evolve over time but for now, here they are:

Keybinding      | What it does                                                      |
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
`Enter`         | Submit and run the current code
`Shift+Enter`   | Inserts a newline without submitting the current code
`Tab`           | Show next completion
`Shift-Tab`     | Show previous completion
`Ctrl-Up`       | Go back through your submission history (current session only)
`Ctrl-Down`     | Go forward through your submission history (current session only)


### 🧙‍♂️ *Magic commands*

Because `dotnet-repl` is built on .NET Interactive, it supports "magic commands". You can recognize a magic command by the `#!` at the start of a line.

You can see the list of supported magic commands by running the `#!help` magic command.
